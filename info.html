    <p>The Leadership of Spectral Fires has been designed to an ever-changing, readily adapative team relative to the needs of the Free Company. We mean to achieve this through a two-tier system of leadership: a permanent <span style="color:rgba(121, 41, 35, 1);"><b>Council</b></span> and a temporary elected team of <span style="color:#3d97ff;"><b>Officers</b></span>. At present, our combined leadership consists of <b>3 Council Members</b> and <b>0 Officers</b></p>
