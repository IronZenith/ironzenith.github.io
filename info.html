The Leadership of Spectral Fires has been designed to an ever-changing, readily adapative team relative to the needs of the Free Company. We mean to achieve this through a two-tier system of leadership: a permanent Council and a temporary elected team of Officers. At present, our combined leadership consists of 3 Council Members and 0 Officers

Our Structure
The Council is the core, permanent leadership of the FC. Led by the guildmasters (Council Leaders), this is the group responsible for making the guiding decisions in the organization. By allowing the FC to be led by the council, as opposed to simply one or two leaders, we hope to keep our ideals fresh and relevant to the needs of the whole. Council members are promoted by a vote of the Council itself, and selections are made on the merit and contributions of an individual to the Free Company.


In similar tone, we have the Officer team. The number of officers in the Free Company at any given time is based on the number of overall members, the number of active members, and the day-to-day needs of the guild. Officers can be raised to office in one of two ways: Either by council appointment, or more commonly by FC election. All Officers hold a temporary, 6 month term, to ensure that the free company's voice is heard, and that the organization is never tptlly controlled by any single group within the larger organization.</div>
