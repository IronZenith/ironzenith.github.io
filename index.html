            <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the homepage for Spectral Fire! Our brand new Free Company strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else. Although we are a relatively new Free Company, our small team of founding leaders come with years of experiencing running large communities both in and out of Final Fantasy XIV. We hope to work to build a new community for players on Jenova where everyone can enjoy the game to it's fullest.</p>

            <p>Spectral Fire was originally concieved as the Spectral Fires back in April of 2021 under the leadership of Vahn'a Minerva. At the time, the goal was to build a fun, casual RP venue using the FC. That goal quickly shifted after conception though, and the idea to build a true FC was concieved. The leadership of the Free Company was passed over to Naoh'li Awandah at the time, as Vahn'a was still busy fulfilling her officer duties in another Free Company. Knowing that the work had already begun to build the foundations on an FC, the choice was made to finish strengthening those foundations before opening to the public. Funds were gathered, airships and submersibles were started, and the FC rank was brought up substansially on the work of a handful of close friends. With the release of Endwalker fast approaching, it finally felt like the right time to put the FC out in the open and start recruiting, and here we are today! We're always looking for new friends to help us grow and start this new adventure together.</p>

            <p>The Leadership of Spectral Fires has been designed to an ever-changing, readily adapative team relative to the needs of the Free Company. We mean to achieve this through a two-tier system of leadership: a permanent <span style="color:rgba(121, 41, 35, 0.8);"><b>Council</b></span> and a temporary elected team of <span style="color:#3d97ff;"><b>Officers</b></span>. At present, our combined leadership consists of <b>3 Council Members</b> and <b>0 Officers</b></p>
            <h3 style="text-align:center;">Our Structure</h3>
              <p><b>The Council</b> is the core, permanent leadership of the FC. Led by the guildmasters (Council Leaders), this is the group responsible for making the guiding decisions in the organization. By allowing the FC to be led by the council, as opposed to simply one or two leaders, we hope to keep our ideals fresh and relevant to the needs of the whole. Council members are promoted by a vote of the Council itself, and selections are made on the merit and contributions of an individual to the Free Company.</p><br>
              <p>In similar tone, we have the <b>Officer</b> team. The number of officers in the Free Company at any given time is based on the number of overall members, the number of active members, and the day-to-day needs of the guild. Officers can be raised to office in one of two ways: Either by council appointment, or more commonly by FC election. All Officers hold a temporary, 6 month term, to ensure that the free company's voice is heard, and that the organization is never tptlly controlled by any single group within the larger organization.</p><br>

            <p>Below is the most basic outline of our expectations for members and officers alike to follow. If you are looking to appeal an action against you, learn more about our escalation policies, or are just in general intersted in a full rundown of our policies, expectations, and the like, click here to view our full FC charter.</p></br>
            <ol>
            <li><b>Be respectul of your Free Company fellows.</b> We do not all have to agree with one another, nor must we see eye-to-eye. That said, we should treat each other with respect. We are in this together, not against one another.
            <li><b>Do not use the Free Company for personal gain.</b> We are a group, and helping one another is encouraged. Using the Free Company only for personal benefit without contributing in return however, is not allowed. What does this mean?
            <ol>
              <li><b>No begging for gil, resources, etc.</b> Asking for help from time to time with certain things is fine. Constantly begging and mooching is not.
                <li><b>Not using the FC to advertise your own ventures.</b> If you stream, run an RP venue, what have you, that's great! We do provide spaces and resources to highlight these things, and any discussion of them should remain to those spaces.
                <li><b>Be respectul of public FC chest resources.</b> If people are generous enough to add raid food, pots, rare items to the FC chest for players to take and use, DO NOT take them out just to sell and further yourself. If anyone is caught doing this you will be barred for all FC chest access indefinitely.
              </ol>
              <li><b>Keep it about the game.</b> We're here to play a game and have fun, so conversations that are just going to cause fights (politics, religion, etc.) can just be left out of public spaces. If you want to have those conversations in private that is your perogative.
              <li><b>Keep spoilers out of public spaces.</b> There is a spoilers channel in the discord specifically for those. Never discuss spoilers in ingame FC chat. If you're not sure, better not to say anything. Spoilers will get you kicked, no second chances.
            </ol>
