            <p>Welcome to the homepage for Spectral Fire! Our brand new Free Company strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else.</p>

We hope to work to build a new community for players on Jenova where everyone can enjoy the game to it's fullest.</p>

            <p>Spectral Fire was originally concieved as the Spectral Fires back in April of 2021 under the leadership of Vahn'a Minerva. At the time, the goal was to build a fun, casual RP venue using the FC. That goal quickly shifted after conception though, and the idea to build a true FC was concieved. The leadership of the Free Company was passed over to Naoh'li Awandah at the time, as Vahn'a was still busy fulfilling her officer duties in another Free Company. Knowing that the work had already begun to build the foundations on an FC, the choice was made to finish strengthening those foundations before opening to the public. Funds were gathered, airships and submersibles were started, and the FC rank was brought up substansially on the work of a handful of close friends. With the release of Endwalker fast approaching, it finally felt like the right time to put the FC out in the open and start recruiting, and here we are today! We're always looking for new friends to help us grow and start this new adventure together.</p>

            </ br></ br>
            <p>The leadership team of Spectral Fire is a simple, two-tier system: Officers and Council Members. Officers are term-based positions, and either appointed by the Council or elected by the membership of the Free company. Council Members are the permanent guiding force behind the Free Company, and are pulled from the officers whom have shown exceptional performance above and beyond the officer role.</p>
