            <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the homepage for Spectral Fire! Our brand new Free Company strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else. Although we are a relatively new Free Company, our small team of founding leaders come with years of experiencing running large communities both in and out of Final Fantasy XIV. We hope to work to build a new community for players on Jenova where everyone can enjoy the game to it's fullest.</p>

          <div class="rheadback rhead"><h1 style="transform: translate(50px, 0px);">About Us</h1></div>
          <p>Recruitment Began May 2022</p> <br>
          <p>Housed in Empyreum, Ward 17, Plot 32</p> <br>
          <p>Rank 30</p>
          <div class="rheadback rhead"><h2 style="transform: translate(50px, 0px);">Leadership Structure</h1></div>
        <p>When planning our FC, we wanted to ensure from the start that we had a leadership system that would be readily adaptible to the needs of the Free Company, and always allow for fresh ideas and new input. At the same time, we know that there needs to be a stable core to maintain the guiding principles of the organization and ensure we stay true to our goals. As a result we settled on having a two-house system of leadership: a permanent <span style="color:rgba(121, 41, 35, 1);"><b>Council</b></span> and a temporary elected team of <span style="color:#3d97ff;"><b>Officers</b></span>. <br><br>
          
          Our current leadership team consists of <b>3 Council Members</b> and <b>0 Officers</b>. For more information about how our leadership works, check out the static charter. You can also find a full list of our officers and council members further down!</p>
          <div class="rheadback rhead"><a id="Leadership"><h2 style="transform: translate(50px, 0px);">Rules</h1></a></div>
          <p>Below is the most basic outline of our expectations for members and officers alike to follow.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>First and foremost be an adult. If you are under 18 and we find out, you're gone. No exception.
            <li>Be respectul of your Free Company fellows. 
            <li>Do not use the Free Company for personal gain.
            <ul>
              <li>No begging for gil, resources, etc.
              <li>Not using the FC to advertise your own ventures.</b>
              <li>Be respectul of public FC chest resources.
            </ul>
            <li>No topics that will actively cause arguments (religion, politics, etc.)
            <li>Keep spoilers out of public spaces.
            </ul>
      <p>In addition, where reasonable, we expect all members to abide by the FFXIV ToS regarding in-game topics. Being an 18+ Free Company we will not be actioning on ToS violations ourselves, but we want to remind all members to be mindful of these policies.  If you are looking to appeal an action against you, learn more about our escalation policies, or are just in general intersted in a full rundown of our policies, expectations, etc., <span class="link" onclick="window.open('rules.html','Spectral Fire Charter','width=800,height=1200')">click here</span> to view our full FC charter.</p>
