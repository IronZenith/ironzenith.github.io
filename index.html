            <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the homepage for Spectral Fire! Our brand new Free Company strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else. Although we are a relatively new Free Company, our small team of founding leaders come with years of experiencing running large communities both in and out of Final Fantasy XIV. We hope to work to build a new community for players on Jenova where everyone can enjoy the game to it's fullest.</p>

          <div class="headback rhead"><h1>Leadership</h1></div>
        <p>When planning our FC, we wanted to ensure from the start that we had a leadership system that would be readily adaptible to the needs of the Free Company, and always allow for fresh ideas and new input. At the same time, we know that there needs to be a stable core to maintain the guiding principles of the organization and ensure we stay true to our goals. As a result we settled on having a two-house system of leadership: a permanent <span style="color:rgba(121, 41, 35, 1);"><b>Council</b></span> and a temporary elected team of <span style="color:#3d97ff;"><b>Officers</b></span>. <br><br>
          
          Our current leadership team consists of <b>3 Council Members</b> and <b>0 Officers</b>. For more information about how our leadership works, or to learn more about the council and our officers, check out our <a href"/officers.html">leadership page</a>!</p>
          <div class="headback rhead"><a id="Leadership"><h1>Rules</h1></a></div>
          <p>Below is the most basic outline of our expectations for members and officers alike to follow. If you are looking to appeal an action against you, learn more about our escalation policies, or are just in general intersted in a full rundown of our policies, expectations, and the like, <a href="/rules.html" target="popup" onclick="window.open('rules.html','Spectral Fire Charter','width=800,height=1200')">click here to view our full FC charter</a>.</p></br>
            <ol>
            <li><b>Be respectul of your Free Company fellows.</b> We do not all have to agree with one another, nor must we see eye-to-eye. That said, we should treat each other with respect. We are in this together, not against one another.
            <li><b>Do not use the Free Company for personal gain.</b> We are a group, and helping one another is encouraged. Using the Free Company only for personal benefit without contributing in return however, is not allowed. What does this mean?
            <ol>
              <li><b>No begging for gil, resources, etc.</b> Asking for help from time to time with certain things is fine. Constantly begging and mooching is not.
                <li><b>Not using the FC to advertise your own ventures.</b> If you stream, run an RP venue, what have you, that's great! We do provide spaces and resources to highlight these things, and any discussion of them should remain to those spaces.
                <li><b>Be respectul of public FC chest resources.</b> If people are generous enough to add raid food, pots, rare items to the FC chest for players to take and use, DO NOT take them out just to sell and further yourself. If anyone is caught doing this you will be barred for all FC chest access indefinitely.
              </ol>
              <li><b>Keep it about the game.</b> We're here to play a game and have fun, so conversations that are just going to cause fights (politics, religion, etc.) can just be left out of public spaces. If you want to have those conversations in private that is your perogative.
              <li><b>Keep spoilers out of public spaces.</b> There is a spoilers channel in the discord specifically for those. Never discuss spoilers in ingame FC chat. If you're not sure, better not to say anything. Spoilers will get you kicked, no second chances.
            </ol>
