            <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the homepage for Spectral Fire! Our brand new Free Company strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else. Although we are a relatively new Free Company, our small team of founding leaders come with years of experiencing running large communities both in and out of Final Fantasy XIV. We hope to work to build a new community for players on Jenova where everyone can enjoy the game to it's fullest.</p>

            <p>Spectral Fire was originally concieved as the Spectral Fires back in April of 2021 under the leadership of Vahn'a Minerva. At the time, the goal was to build a fun, casual RP venue using the FC. That goal quickly shifted after conception though, and the idea to build a true FC was concieved. The leadership of the Free Company was passed over to Naoh'li Awandah at the time, as Vahn'a was still busy fulfilling her officer duties in another Free Company. Knowing that the work had already begun to build the foundations on an FC, the choice was made to finish strengthening those foundations before opening to the public. Funds were gathered, airships and submersibles were started, and the FC rank was brought up substansially on the work of a handful of close friends. With the release of Endwalker fast approaching, it finally felt like the right time to put the FC out in the open and start recruiting, and here we are today! We're always looking for new friends to help us grow and start this new adventure together.</p>
