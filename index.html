            <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the homepage for Spectral Fire! Our brand new Free Company strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else. Although we are a relatively new Free Company, our small team of founding leaders come with years of experiencing running large communities both in and out of Final Fantasy XIV. We hope to work to build a new community for players on Jenova where everyone can enjoy the game to it's fullest.</p>

            <p>Spectral Fire was originally concieved as the Spectral Fires back in April of 2021 under the leadership of Vahn'a Minerva. At the time, the goal was to build a fun, casual RP venue using the FC. That goal quickly shifted after conception though, and the idea to build a true FC was concieved. The leadership of the Free Company was passed over to Naoh'li Awandah at the time, as Vahn'a was still busy fulfilling her officer duties in another Free Company. Knowing that the work had already begun to build the foundations on an FC, the choice was made to finish strengthening those foundations before opening to the public. Funds were gathered, airships and submersibles were started, and the FC rank was brought up substansially on the work of a handful of close friends. With the release of Endwalker fast approaching, it finally felt like the right time to put the FC out in the open and start recruiting, and here we are today! We're always looking for new friends to help us grow and start this new adventure together.</p>

                 <p>The leadership team of Spectral Fire is a simple, two-tier system: Officers and Council Members. Officers are term-based positions, and either appointed by the Council or elected by the membership of the Free company. Council Members are the permanent guiding force behind the Free Company, and are pulled from the officers whom have shown exceptional performance above and beyond the officer role.</p>

            <li><b>Be respectul of your Free Company fellows.</b> We do not all have to agree with one another, nor must we see eye-to-eye. That said, we should treat each other with respect. We are in this together, not against one another.
            <li><b>Do not use the Free Company for personal gain.</b> We are a group, and helping one another is encouraged. Using the Free Company only for personal benefit without contributing in return however, is not allowed. What does this mean?
            <ol>
              <li>No begging for gil, resources, etc. Asking for help from time to time with certain things is fine. Constantly begging and mooching is not.
              <li>Not using the FC to advertise your own ventures. If you stream, run an RP venue, what have you, that's great! We do provide spaces and resources to highlight these things, and any discussion of them should remain to those spaces.
              <li>Be respectul of public FC chest resources. If people are generous enough to add raid food, pots, rare items to the FC chest for players to take and use, DO NOT take them out just to sell and further yourself. If anyone is caught doing this you will be barred for all FC chest access indefinitely.
              </ol>
            <li>Keep it about the game. We're here to play a game and have fun, so conversations that are just going to cause fights (politics, religion, etc.) can just be left out of public spaces. If you want to have those conversations in private that is your perogative.
            <li>Keep spoilers out of public spaces. There is a spoilers channel in the discord specifically for those. Never discuss spoilers in ingame FC chat. If you're not sure, better not to say anything. Spoilers will get you kicked, no second chances.
