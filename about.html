          <h3>About XIVPlanner</h3>
          <p>XIV Planner is a website run by a single individual, with the goal of providing FFXIV players a similar resource to Raidplan.io. XIVPlanner is <b>not</b> meant to replace other tools in the XIV space, such as FFXIV Toolbox, but rather designed to work in conjunction with them to provide adequate resources for all players both in and out of raid nights.</p>
        
          </p>For the longest time, XIV Raiders in the world race, week one, and blind raiding scenes have been relegated to using things like Microsoft Paint to crudely draw diagrams for strategies as they prog and advance. FFXIV Toolbox has always been a wonderful tool for use outside of the raid night, but trying to create a new strat mid-lockout can be time-intensive and wasteful. <b>XIV Planner is designed to improve upon this situation.<b> Stream your browser via Discord, Twitch, or other services to provide your team with a live whiteboard that you can quickly update and adapt. Move individual player icons in real-time to isolate explanations to players, make use of standardized markers so that everyone is on the same page with mechanics, and show safe spots on the arenas themselves with versatile floor telegraphs.</p>
