            <p>XIV Planner is a website run by a single individual, with the goal of providing FFXIV players a similar resource to Raidplan.io. XIVPlanner is <b>not</b> meant to replace other tools in the XIV space, such as FFXIV Toolbox, but rather designed to work in conjunction with them to provide adequate resources for all players both in and out of raid nights.</p>
        
            <p>For the longest time, XIV Raiders in the world race, week one, and blind raiding scenes have been relegated to using things like Microsoft Paint to crudely draw diagrams for strategies as they prog and advance. FFXIV Toolbox has always been a wonderful tool for use outside of the raid night, but trying to create a new strat mid-lockout can be time-intensive and wasteful. <b>XIV Planner is designed to improve upon this situation.</b> Stream your browser via Discord, Twitch, or other services to provide your team with a live whiteboard that you can quickly update and adapt. Move individual player icons in real-time to isolate explanations to players, make use of standardized markers so that everyone is on the same page with mechanics, and show safe spots on the arenas themselves with versatile floor telegraphs.</p>

              <p>As far as upkeep of the actual site, coding, and the like, while I appreciate offers for help I very much treat this as a hobby and something to occupy my time. If the time comes where I no longer feel like I can maintain the site in a timely manner for it to be a viable tool, I will open things up for other people to step in and help. At the time being though, I would like to continue to design and maintain the site on my own. It doesn't take a lot of work to update the site with new fights, so it isn't a huge drawback for me to operate it alone.</p>
              
              <p>You <i>can</i> help by submitting photos of arenas for me to update older fights, <b>in particular Ulimates</b>. While I can pull some of the ulimate arenas from other fights in a pinch, they are not always identical, and in some cases like the Dragonsong War they use entirely new arenas. I am not an ultimate raider myself, and lack the group that is willing to prog these fights to acquire these arena images on my own. Images need to be submitted in JPEG/JPG format (for quicker load times), and the higher the resolution the better. <u>Mininmum accepted resolution is 1920x1080.</u></p>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">Q: <span style="color: #EEEEEE">How do you plan to update with new content so quickly?</span></h3>
              <p>I have set up the site in such a way that the toolbox itself is essentially a template page, so it only ever needs to be made once. With that done, the only info I actually need to be able to set up new raid pages are the raid names and arena screenshots. The raid names have always prior been revealed to us in the patch notes during the maintenance, so the pages can be configured and pushed live <b>with arenas designated</b> before the game ever goes live. Then the only delaying factor is how long it takes for me to get into the nomral content and clear it. I realistically expect to have new content uploaded within the hour of a patch going live, barring rare circumstances that may prevent me from doing so.</p>

              <p>The sole caveat to this would be door boss situations where the arena is changed or other savage-only arenas. I am traditionally not in savage until evening of day one. I am typically doing day one is watch RWF and monitoring news surrounding the game, so I will be aware if these things exist. <b>If you are using this on day one in Savage and reach an arena not present in normal, send me an image and I will have it updated ASAP.</b> Alternatively, it is very easy using the inspect tool on most modern browsers to substitute the arena image yourself until I have been able to patch it.</p>

              <p>Due to the way I have chosen to setup the site, and considering the target audience of the site/current statistics on montior usage, I made the decision to have the site operate at a <b>minimum</b> resolution of 1920x1080. If you are running the site at a lower resolution than this, I cannot guarantee that it will work properly. I do not currently intend to lower this resolution requirement.</p>

              <p>The planner itself is designed to be used with a mouse. Even if you could access the site on a mobile browser, you would not be able to utitlize the toolbox itself.</p>

              <p>No. XIVPlanner is not designed to be used to show multi-stage diagrams nor is that the intent of the site. The idea is to use this site during raid nights to help better explain mechanics or solve mechanics blind. <b>XIVPlanner is not meant to replace FFXIV Toolbox for saving and sharing multi-stage diagrams.</b></p>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">Q: <span style="color: #EEEEEE">Where are the other ARR Trials?</span></h3>
              <p>ARR has a lot of trials that only act as normal mode story content or side content, such as the relic trials. Since these are very easily cleared and do not really have a need for planning, they have been omitted from the site. Only trials with an EX difficulty are included here. This also extends to Hildibrand trials for subsequent expansions, such as Kugane Ohashi.</p>

              <h3 style="margin-top: 5px;">Q: <span style="color: #EEEEEE">Will you ever add 24-man/48-man raids?</span></h3>
              <p>In regards to 24 man content, it is very unlikely that I will be adding them in the near-future for much the same reason that certain trials are omitted. By the time these were updated and added to the site, they would realistically not be needed. 48-man content may be added eventually, since these are high-end raids. I will be waiting to see how such content is implemented in Endwalker before making a decision on this, since it is currently not valuable to add.</p>
