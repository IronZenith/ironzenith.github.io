  <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: -8px">Welcome to XIVPlanner</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 10px;">XIVPlanner is a new raiding-focused website designed much in same vein as WOW's raidplan.io. This website is not meant to replace the existing raid tools that exist, such as the FFXIV Toolbox, but instead work in conjunction with them to fill a hole in the resources currently available to the community. Where FFXIV Toolbox is a great tool for showing pre-made strategies, it takes time to build those slideshows and is generally something done outside of raid. XIV Planner is meant for on-the-fly strategy creation, discussion, and more in-raid decision making.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 10px;">The website is currently in a <b>very</b> early stage of development, and as such a lot of content will be missing or just outright broken. Over the next few weeks, I hope to have the whiteboard close to it's final form. It is already somewhat functional; you can check it out by navigating into the raid menu and heading to Fulmination. When completed, the whiteboard will include a well-rounded assortment of ground AOEs, all common telegraphed mechanics, togglable arenas (for those fights with multiple arenas), and more. The blueprint feature will be provide blank, grid-template arenas where you can draw your own arenas, for those day one raiders who are in the fights faster than I am. On that front, it is my goal to have most fights ready early day-one.
      
     <p style="font-size: 10px;">I hope you can find some use from this website as it's functions are fleshed out, and I look forward to your feedback!</p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: -8px">Planned Updates</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 10px;">This is the current planned order of updates. I do not intend to provide a hard timeline for any of this beyond the base functionality of the whiteboard itself.</p>
      <ul style="font-size: 10px;">
        <li> Complete whiteboard functionality by Endwalker Release
        <li> Add Endwalker 6.0 Content
        <li> Complete Eden Raid Tier Pages
        <li> Add in Blueprints
        <li> Finish Navigation Pages
        <li> Add Shadowbringers Trials
        <li> Add Stormblood Content
        <li> Add Heavensward Content
        <li> Add A Realm Reborn Content
        <li> Add Ultimates*
      </ul>
      
      <p style="font-size: 10px;">If you would like to send me arena images for any of these fights (especially Ultimates as I am unable to acquire these), please use the contact info (when added) to talk to me about sending these files. I would ask that they are <u>unobstructed, full, top-down arena photos in .jpg format, at least 800px in height.</u> I cannot use any arena images that do not meet those minimum specifications.</p>
