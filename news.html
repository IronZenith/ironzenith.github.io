    <p>XIVPlanner is a new raiding-focused website designed much in same vein as WOW's raidplan.io. This website is not meant to replace the existing raid tools, such as the FFXIV Toolbox, but instead work in conjunction with them to fill a hole in the resources currently available to the community. Where FFXIV Toolbox is a great tool for showing pre-made strategies outside of raid time, XIV Planner is meant for on-the-fly strategy creation, discussion, and more in-raid decision making during the raid night.</p>
    
    <p>The website is currently in a <b>very</b> early stage of development, and as such a lot of content will be missing or just outright broken. Over the next few weeks, I hope to have the whiteboard close to it's final form. It is already somewhat functional; you can check it out by navigating into the raid menu and heading to Fulmination. When completed, the whiteboard will include a well-rounded assortment of ground AOEs, all common telegraphed mechanics, togglable arenas (for those fights with multiple arenas), and more. The blueprint feature will be provide blank, grid-template arenas where you can draw your own arenas, for those day one raiders who are in the fights faster than I am. On that front, it is my goal to have most fights ready early day-one.
      
     <p>I hope you can find some use from this website as it's functions are fleshed out, and I look forward to your feedback!</p>
