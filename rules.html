Spectral Fires strives to be an inclusive, welcoming space for the adult FFXIV community. Our goal is simple: Be the best we can be, and build a community that values respect for others above all else.

1. Be respectul of your Free Company fellows. We do not all have to agree with one another, nor must we see eye-to-eye. That said, we should treat each other with respect. We are in this together, not against one another.

2. Do not use the Free Company for personal gain. We are a group, and helping one another is encouraged. Using the Free Company only for personal benefit without contributing in return however, is not allowed. What does this mean?
  2.1. No begging for gil, resources, etc. Asking for help from time to time with certain things is fine. Constantly begging and mooching is not.
  2.2. Not using the FC to advertise your own ventures. If you stream, run an RP venue, what have you, that's great! We do provide spaces and resources to highlight these things, and any discussion of them should remain to those spaces.
  2.3. Be respectul of public FC chest resources. If people are generous enough to add raid food, pots, rare items to the FC chest for players to take and use, DO NOT take them out just to sell and further yourself. If anyone is caught doing this you will be barred for all FC chest access indefinitely.

3. Keep it about the game. We're here to play a game and have fun, so conversations that are just going to cause fights (politics, religion, etc.) can just be left out of public spaces. If you want to have those conversations in private that is your perogative.

4. Keep spoilers out of public spaces. There is a spoilers channel in the discord specifically for those. Never discuss spoilers in ingame FC chat. If you're not sure, better not to say anything. Spoilers will get you kicked, no second chances.
